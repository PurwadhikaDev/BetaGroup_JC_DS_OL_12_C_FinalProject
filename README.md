# <b><u> üèß Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis </b></u>
by Anisha Ayu Putri Mayangsari, Vincent Tristan, Wilson Widjaja<br><br>
This is a final project dedicated for Purwadhika Data Science online class on the topic of Machine Learning using the use case of Bank Marketing Campaign. The data is obtained from  [Bank Marketing Campaign](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/volodymyrgavrysh/bank-marketing-campaigns-dataset).
<br><br>
In this project, our objective is to predict whether the existing bank customer is going to accept a deposit offer or not. The focus in this analysis is to focus on both minimizing False Positive and False Negative, thus we're using F1 score metrics to improve in our model<br>
<br>
The model we use is classification and the aim is to get the best model & resampler method that works best on our existing dataset. Below is our final confusion matrix used by the best model.<br>

In short, our analysis consisted of multiple steps as follows:
1. Problem Statement & Goals Understanding
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Data Preparation (Feature Selection & Feature Engineering)
5. Modelling
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
7. Model Limitation
8. Probability Based Strategy
9. Model Saving
10. Conclusion & Recommendation

From this sequence, we can get recommended actions and numbers comparison on the current sales strategy and the strategy incurred using the Machine Learning model. The model is able to give recommendation on cost saving & maximizing revenue based on the marketing team needs. The final model used is Gradient Boosting Classifier with SMOTE as dataset resampler.<br>
The potential benefit from this Machine Learning model includes:<br>
1. Cost Saving: ‚Üì EUR 6,867 (86% cost efficiency)
2. Maximize Revenue: ‚Üë EUR 3,721,687 (70% revenue growth)
